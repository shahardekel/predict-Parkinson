# predict-Parkinson
we will try to predict the medical status of people with Parkinson's disease using their speech data.
we will use the file "parkinsons_updrs.names.txt" and "parkinsons_updrs_data.csv"

a. Load the data using the Pandas library.

b. How many males and females are in the data (including multiple appearances)? Show a bar plot.

c. Visualize the distribution of the ages with a histogram.

d. How does the mean of the variable "motor_UPDRS" varies between different sexes? Visualize it using a bar plot (use groupby).

e. Choose 6 explanatory variables and display a scatter plot of them with the response variable motor_UPDRS (use the function scatter_matrix()).

f. Use sklearn's built-in functions to calculate the LS estimator, using only the 6 explanatory variables you chose in the previous section.

g. Use the function from question 2 to calculate the least squares estimator, using only the 6 explanatory variables you chose in the section e.
Did you get the same answer as in the previous section?
